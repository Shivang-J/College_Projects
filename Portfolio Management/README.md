**Overview**

This project, created during my 2nd year of college, leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict stock prices. 
It includes one dataset pre-processing code, two traditional machine learning algorithms, and one deep learning algorithm that forecasts the price of any stock for the next trading day based on historical data.

**Project Components**
1) Dataset Pre-Processing: Efficient data cleaning and preparation for model training.
2) Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms:
        -Linear Regression
        -Random Forest
3) Deep Learning Algorithm:
        -Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network

**Applications**
1) Portfolio Management: Assisting investors in making informed decisions by predicting stock prices and optimizing their investment strategies.
2) Algorithmic Trading: Developing automated trading strategies based on stock price predictions to maximize returns.
3) Financial Analysis: Providing insights into market trends and stock performance for analysts and financial advisors.
4) Risk Management: Identifying potential risks by forecasting market movements and helping in devising mitigation strategies.
